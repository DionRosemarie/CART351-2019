<p>Since the biblical times, and even before that, womenâ€™s role in our society have been restricted. Man always had power over the other genders. Today, even with the feminism movements, we still have some scares of the past. In some domaine, the representation of women is not equal or women have difficulty to make their way into it, especially in the tech industry. In 2018, 20% of all jobs in technology were held by women. This low statistic is not due to the fact that man are omnipresent, but more due to the fact that there is a low representation of inspiring female role models in this field. In the next few years, a new wave a women will come searching for jobs. Like mentioned before, the big representation of men in this industry for decades leaves scares. Even with the new generations coming in, the mentality will still be the same. Now is the time to make a change before it is too late. More and more events are starting to take place to encourage young girls to explore the tech industry. Companies are taking the times to teach them what it is all about and push them to succeed by giving them formations and tools. With this new state of mind, this project would be a nice reference to have in your pocket. Little girls that are interested in coding or developing their own app would be able to get in touch with women around them. They will be able to explore the map and see that there is more women in this industry that they think. Maybe giving them the chance to see feminine role models near them will encourage them to continue in this path.</p>
