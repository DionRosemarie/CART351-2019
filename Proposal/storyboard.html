<p>With these three source of inspiration, my project would differ from them. Building hopes and Paperplanes are two good examples for the exploration space criteria. The ivyConnection is more useful for the informations aspect of my project. Just as a remidner, the Not Just a Man’s World is intended to be a platform where people can grow as women in the tech industry. To make this happen, we need to collect data about the user, just like Building Hopes. Then, the profile will be display to see where the other users are, just like Paperplane. Once these two steps are done, just like the ivyConnection, users will be able to reach out with others depending on their interests. My project is going to differ from the three example due to the fact that it is a combination of the three. Separately, each project are interesting, but put together, it is going to make a stronger and complete tool of communication. This assemble, compare to the others, will challenge the women’s place in the tech industry by engaging more experience women with the younger generation. The three websites comes to live with the input of the users. My project will comes to live with the input of the users. By engaging on the plateform, the outcome will helps younger girls to pursuit their path with the help and encouragement of role models.</p>
