  This project is interesting and relevant to my research due to the fact the interactive aspect. The goal is to create a hopes tower that is represented by stones with different subjects just like environment, world peace, equality etc. Each of them goes in a circle motion and the user just have to select one after the other. When a choice is made, you can choose how important this matter is to you. Your answer is going to affect the size go the stone. Once the tower is done, the result will appear next to other users results. With the colours and the size of each stones, we can understand what are the interests of others. I think this website is interesting for the interactive aspect based on a community and how the input of the user affects the results. Also, the way that the responding elements were conceptualize is interesting. The main idea behind the building hopes project is different to what I have seen before. Creating your own tower on its own is fun, but adding the interests and values aspect make it more special. I think this project is a good inspiration and starting point because they focused more on the back end than the front end. This interface is memorable not only for the visual but for the interactiveness. To respond to the explorable space, I think it will be a good way to give more energy into the conception of the core than the visuals. I came to this realization by finding this website. Overall, the building hopes project is what I want to achieve with a different subject.<br><br>
<a href="https://paperplanes.world">Paper Planes</a><br>
This project is a great source of inspiration for its interactive aspect. Once you go on the website, you have a paper plane going around. After a couple of tricks, you see the planet earth appearing. This platform only works with the input of a cellphone. The app version of this project let you build your own plane and put a stamp of your location on it. Once the plane is folded, you can throw it in the atmosphere and watch were it goes.  On the website you can watch where some planes arrived. Your plane can go anywhere on any continents. You can track it on your phone and have as many try as you want. Compare to the building hope project, this website was chosen based only on the interactivity. I really think itâ€™s different to have an app that affects the end result of a different platform. This could be a nice touch to my project to add, in some the of way, the input of cellphone. This could be in a way to make it evolve my first idea and make it grow in something better for my personal skills and also for the user experiences.<br><br>

<a href="https://www.ivyconnection.com">Paper Planes</a><br>
This project is similar to the one I am trying to build. Compare to the two above, this one is closer to goal due to the fact that it is based on a community and not just the interactiveness created by the input of the user. Ivy League is a regroupment of eight private college based in the United States. It is an honour to attend one those establishment which make sense many international student would like to apply there. IvyConnection in a Korean website created with the intent to help students go study to their dream institution. This website is a great tool for students throughout their application process. They creator of this project reunited on a same platform different advisor and teacher to help the students. They can contact them or even read different blog posts about related subject. This website was created with the goal of building a community that can help each other to attend the same goal just like project. They both wants to bring something on to the table and take something out of it.The design is clean and minimalist which helps to understand where to go easily. This artistic direction is also young to fit with the users. I think it is a good source of inspiration due to the similarities but also because of the use of informations. The design is clear which helps to find what you want quickly. This website is less about the experience but more about realizing your goal. The small interactions of transitions are a small touch that made the different part more distinguishable. Overall, the ivyConnections was chose as an inspiration for displaying information in dynamic way and give student access to a community to attend their dream college.
